Truth Serum is a collection of poems that spans 20 years of discovery and revelation. Observing, witnessing and experiencing the loom of love's luster and lack. Celebrating the beauty of love's crescendos and moments of sheer nirvana. Each poem tells a story or begs to ask questions of how honestly we love.
