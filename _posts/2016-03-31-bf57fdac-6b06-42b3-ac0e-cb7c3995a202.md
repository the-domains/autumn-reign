FOR THE LOVE OF TEA

Toasting, drinking, testing new flavors aromas pleasantly
kissing my nose while sanctifying my chemo senses with warm vapors charming my
senses alluring me to what I love most

The molecules and meeting of my taste buds and tongue welcoming
micro-spices and herbs massaging the crevices of my mouth, awakening endings of
sensory with caresses of honey chamomile and vanilla, whispering sweet nothings
to my brain, introducing images stroking my hard and soft palate

What a wonder I experience undertaking the romance I have with
TEA, see we have been together for over thirty years and I must say even
through the hard times, he never left my side, always letting me know there was
a warm place I could come home to

see even when I was feeling the brash winds of life's roller coaster

I would be beckoned to the new quiet peaceful place of Chai 

see he was boldly flavorsome challenging me to pay close attention to its
detail and delight ginger cinnamon and cardamom blessing me with fiery bursts
it is enlightenment to my soul summoning me to savor the full experience while
dancing with the many sugar cubes in my cup that have now traveled to my head

This love affair with tea will not end for I cannot deny him in
the spring winter and fal, for with him is where I choose to be and knowing
that each meeting is like fresh spearmint in my soul with 10,000 tantalizing
tenants engulfing me with a little bit heaven in my tea cup
