Format: Paperback

Verified PurchaseThe book Truth Serum "Watering Seasons of My Love " By Autumn Reign is a composite of the truths, many if not all of us have experienced and wanted to shout about. It captures and puts into words the pain and agony of lost trust and new love,it resounds loudly with flavors of wishes,dreams and realities. It is a must read for the lovers at heart,the lost and lonely, and those who may have given up on love in its harshest experiences. It is a must for those who want to feel their passions and see them in writing through another's voice. "Truth Serum" speaks to many truths within many souls. It speaks of desires,disappointments,and many realizations,and it refreshes us to know that Love is all encompassing and not simply of love to one another but of a universal nature that can leave us scarred,dismayed,and disenchanted, but what it points out most is the growth and maturity that comes with each new encounter, the reality that Love evolves just as we do, it changes and morphs, it lifts and drops, it is many things to each of us and with out it we could not live to suffer its truths ..nor could we live to experience its wonderful playfulness and truthfulness with our minds and hearts ..we could not live with out the seasons of Love and its ever changing ways , hence "Watering Seasons Of My Love" is a perfect follow of the title "Truth Serum" the book .
