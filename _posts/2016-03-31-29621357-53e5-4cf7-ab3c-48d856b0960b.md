BROKEN WING

Black swan, your wing span is wide, the strokes startle and
your embrace is one of sultry movements with grace

You mesmerize and tantalize with your sweetness, it suffocates
as feelings of ecstasy cloak me

I lose sight and oxygen leaves my body simultaneously the
other swan takes her last breath,

She begins to sink slowly, even graciously into the afterlife

(Pause)

Naw,

I am just a black girl with a broken wing

,
See I have been through many things

See each time I am ignored, abused or disregarded,

I can feel the particles of my heart separate from my soul

Departed, disconnecting the valve from the aorta,

I realize that I am made strong to overcome the pain

I have been overtaken by the Black Swan,
For she lives in me,

But

I am just a strong black girl with a broken wing!
