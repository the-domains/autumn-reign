Love Jones   Nov. 20 2012

By pshannon Published on Amazon.com

Format: Paperback

[__][0]

I read this book of poetry and found rhythm in a cadence that is hard to come by and difficult for a poet to deliver. This book was and still is a pleasant surprise! I read the poem "Love Jones" and recognized my relationship with my husband in those words, images, and emotions evoked after reading it. I read it to him that night and he agreed "...this is a description of our love." This book is a keeper and one that I will come back to repetitively through the years because the rhythm, cadence, and imagery speaks volumes. This author has accomplished a feat that few poets are able to pull off and that is being able to convey the most intimate, innermost thoughts by speaking from the heart and soul. She poured her heart and soul into these poems, which is why they capture your attention and make you reflect upon your relationships of the heart. Congratulations Autumn Reign! I can't wait to read the next one!
