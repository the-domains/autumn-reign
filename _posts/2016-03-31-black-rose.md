BLACK ROSE

Black Rose stand strong and tall, for many of the forces will
encourage you to fall.

Black Rose, there is always a sun with a beam of light to guide
you through your gloomy days and your darkest night.

Black Rose, do not be fooled by the cunning smile or the small
opportunities that exist for a short while

Black Rose, put your stake in life's grounddo not let your
indecision be the conqueror of your true destiny.

Black Rose, tomorrow waits for no one, today is sure to pass
and yesterday is just a fading memory.

Black Rose, use your petal as shields for life's abundance of
disappointments, let them protect you.

Black Rose, you are the seed of life for tomorrow that is feared
by so many today.
